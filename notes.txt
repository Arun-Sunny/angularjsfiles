Angular JS directives

1) they are basically used to like add "things" to html

2) to do it, just add the ng-<CORRESPONDING DIRECTIVE>

3) CORRESPONDING DIRECTIVEs include:-
    ng-app
    ng-init
    ng-bind
    ng-model

4) ng-app :- apply it to whatever tag you need angular JS

5) ng-model :- You use it to bind html controls to application data.
    for example, suppose you want a reactive text field, you add this to the
    input tag of the text. Whatever is in {{}} will be replaced in.
    also, yoU can use ng-model for validation.
    <form ng-app="" name="myForm" ng-init="myText = 'post@myweb.com'">
    Email:
    <input type="email" name="myAddress" ng-model="myText" required>
    <h1>Status</h1>
    {{myForm.myAddress.$valid}}
    {{myForm.myAddress.$dirty}}
    {{myForm.myAddress.$touched}}
    </form>

    also, ng-model can be used to check validation like for example, email
    <form ng-app="" name="myForm">
    Email:
    <input type="email" name="myAddress" ng-model="text">
    <span ng-show="myForm.myAddress.$error.email">Not a valid e-mail address</span>
    </form>
